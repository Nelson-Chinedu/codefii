Codefii is a superfast micro-framework, the first of its
  kind delivered as a general purpose framework to give acces and control and security to web Ninjas.
  Just as the name implies, codefii is a general purpose framework, it's doesn't force you to write in a particular pattern, once you have a prior knowledge of php you are good to go.
  the installation of the framework can be found on the official website https://codefii.com/documentation.
  However, the framework is open for contribution as that is the only way it can grow beyond the administrative stage to production stage.
