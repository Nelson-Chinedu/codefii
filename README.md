Codefii is a superfast micro-framework, the first of its
  kind delivered as a general purpose framework to give acces and control and security to web Ninjas.
  Just as the name implies, codefii is a general purpose framework, it's doesn't force you to write in a particular pattern, once you have a prior knowledge of php you are good to go.
  the installation of the framework can be found on the official website https://codefii.com/documentation.
  However, the framework is open for contribution as that is the only way it can grow beyond the administrative stage to production stage.
The aim is to keep everything simple and clear while speed and data optimization remains our major focus. currently,we use whatsapp as a communication platform with our contributors; if your interested in making codefii the number one African php framework while your name will appear on the website as one of the contributors, hit the whatsapp channel using https://chat.whatsapp.com/3gTM7Odu53JcSNI9m0AIz
